# Webserver-configuration-on-AWS-EC2-using-Ansible

ðŸ¤”Did you ever want to provision and configure a web server on Amazon Web Services (AWS) without going to the AWS Portal or even without knowing AWS? Follow my approach of doing this using Ansible by Red Hat!  âœ¨

What unique you will get:

ðŸŒŸ Without even going once to the portal you can provision ec2 and configure it as a web server and launch your website.

ðŸŒŸ Get the URL of the webserver while executing the ansible code. You again don't have to use AWS Portal.
